On the other hand, take a little warm water and mix the yeast in it along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15 minutes. The yeast will rise in the meantime.

    <h3>Step 2 Prepare the pizza base</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.</p>

However, make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>One of the basic tips is to make sure that you have preheated the oven. In case you are using a standard oven then make sure it‚Äôs preheated at 280 degree Celsius.</li>
        <li>In case you are using a readymade base, make sure it‚Äôs not cold. Make sure that you take it out half an hour before you start making the pizza.</li>
        <li>Don‚Äôt roll the dough, stretch it to make the base. This means if you are making the fresh pizza base, the dough will be at room temperature and it would be easy to stretch it.</li>
        <li>The best way to make restaurant-style pizza is to use a pizza stone, as it helps the dough in rising and makes it crisp as well. Go for it.</li>
        <li>If you want to use an organic approach in your pizza, then you can use the fresh tomato puree or paste. This will make your pizza more delicious.</li>
